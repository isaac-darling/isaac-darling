### Hello! My name is Isaac Darling and I am a third year college student studying computer science. I have been learning to code for the last 5 years or so, and I look forward to many more.

### My favorite code-related fun fact is:

```Python
NaN = float("nan")
NaN is NaN  # True
NaN == NaN  # False
```
